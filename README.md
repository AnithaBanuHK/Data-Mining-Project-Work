F21DL Data Mining and Machine Learning:  


This project work is designed to help you understand and enhance your experience with:
1.	Methods for data exploration, preparation and analysis, including calculating correlation of features and performing feature selection. 
2.	Unsupervised Learning and Clustering
3.	Supervised Learning and the problems of generalization and overfitting; Supervised learning methods including Naïve Bayes, Linear Regression, K-nearest neighbors and Decision trees
4.	Cutting Edge machine learning techniques: Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural networks 

The data set: 
In your coursework you will work with an image data set (Traffic sign data set). A detailed description of the data set together with all downloadable files can be found in CourseWorkData Link. You will report your main findings on this data set but feel free to experiment and run your code with other data sets as well.
Exploring different data sets might be useful for future projects, for your dissertation or if you would like to score bonus points by showing “extra effort and creativity”. Starting your experiments with a simple data set can help you understand some basic concepts.

What to do:

Part 1. Data Analysis and Bayes Nets.  
Part 2. Clustering. 
Part 3. Supervised Learning: Generalisation & Overfitting; Decision trees. 
Part 4. Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. 
Part 5. Research Work
